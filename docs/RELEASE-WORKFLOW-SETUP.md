# Release Workflow Setup Guide

This guide explains how to configure a repository to use the standard `release.yaml` workflow. The same checklist applies whether you are bootstrapping a new repo from `repo-template` or auditing an existing one.

## Overview

The release workflow triggers when you **publish a GitHub Release** and implements a comprehensive validation and automatic deployment process that:
- ✅ Tests all target frameworks per test project on Windows
- ✅ Enforces 90% code coverage threshold
- ✅ Validates NuGet package integrity with smoke tests
- ✅ Automatically publishes to NuGet.org after validation passes
- ✅ Eliminates duplicate build work for faster releases

## Required Configuration

Complete the following one-time setup so that the workflow can publish releases:

### Configure NuGet Trusted Publishing (OIDC)

Publishing uses [NuGet Trusted Publishing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/trusted-publishing) via `NuGet/login@v1` in `release.yaml`. There is **no long-lived `NUGET_API_KEY` repository secret** — at release time the workflow exchanges its GitHub OIDC token for an ephemeral (~1 hour) push key, so there is no standing credential to rotate or leak.

**Location:** nuget.org → account `Chris-Wolfgang` → Manage → Trusted Publishing

Create one policy **per package ID** (this repo ships two packages, so it needs two policies):

- `Wolfgang.Extensions.IAsyncEnumerable`
- `Wolfgang.Extensions.IAsyncEnumerable.Legacy`

Each policy's fields:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Repository owner | `Chris-Wolfgang` |
| Repository | `IAsyncEnumerable-Extensions` |
| Workflow file | `release.yaml` |
| Environment | *(blank)* |

**What this does:** Authorizes this repository's `release.yaml` workflow — and only it — to push the named package. This is a one-time setup per package; nothing needs periodic renewal.

### Verify Branch Protection Rules

**Location:** Settings → Branches → main (or Settings → Rules → Rulesets)

> **Note:** This repo's `scripts/Fix-BranchRuleset.ps1` can update the ruleset's required status checks. For initial ruleset creation, configure the settings manually using the checklist below (Settings → Rules → Rulesets).

Ensure the following settings are enabled:

- ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
  - **Single developer repos:** 0 approvals (default)
  - **Multi-developer repos:** 1+ approvals (recommended)
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - Required checks should include the following status check contexts:
    - "Stage 1: Linux Tests (.NET 5.0-10.0) + Coverage Gate"
    - "Stage 2: Windows Tests (.NET 5.0-10.0, Framework 4.6.2-4.8.1)"
    - "Stage 3: macOS Tests (.NET 6.0-10.0)"
    - "Security Scan (DevSkim)"
    - "Security Scan (CodeQL)"
- ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
- ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**
- ✅ **Do not allow bypassing the above settings** (recommended, even for admins)
- ✅ **Restrict deletions**
- ✅ **Require linear history** (optional but recommended)

**What this does:** Ensures all code merged to `main` has passed comprehensive validation, preventing broken releases.

## Testing the Release Workflow

After completing the setup, test the workflow by creating a GitHub Release:

1. Go to your repository's **Releases** page
2. Click **"Draft a new release"**
3. Choose or create a tag (e.g., `v0.0.1-test`)
4. Add a title and description (optional for a test)
5. Check **"Set as a pre-release"** for test releases
6. Click **"Publish release"**

The workflow triggers automatically when the release is published.

### Expected Workflow Behavior

1. **Job 1: validate-release** (3-10 minutes)
   - Runs all framework tests with coverage
   - Enforces 90% coverage threshold
   - Uploads coverage report
   - ✅ Auto-passes if tests succeed

2. **Job 2: pack-and-validate** (2-5 minutes)
   - Packs NuGet packages
   - Performs smoke test installation
   - Uploads packages as artifacts
   - ✅ Auto-passes if packages are valid

3. **Job 3: publish-nuget** (1-2 minutes)
   - Exchanges the workflow's OIDC token for an ephemeral (~1h) push key via `NuGet/login@v1`
   - Publishes packages to NuGet.org automatically
   - ✅ Auto-completes if the Trusted Publishing policies are configured

### Monitoring the Workflow

- **Actions Tab:** Shows workflow progress in real-time
- **Artifacts:** Each job uploads artifacts (coverage reports, packages)
- **Releases:** Check the Releases page after successful completion

## Troubleshooting

### OIDC Login / Push Fails in `publish-nuget`

**Problem:** The `NuGet/login@v1` step (or the subsequent push) fails.

**Solution:** A failed OIDC exchange means the Trusted Publishing policy is missing or misconfigured on nuget.org.
1. Check nuget.org → account `Chris-Wolfgang` → Manage → Trusted Publishing
2. Verify a policy exists for **each** package ID (`Wolfgang.Extensions.IAsyncEnumerable` and `Wolfgang.Extensions.IAsyncEnumerable.Legacy`) with owner `Chris-Wolfgang`, repository `IAsyncEnumerable-Extensions`, workflow file `release.yaml`, and a blank environment
3. Re-run the workflow from the Actions tab (do not re-publish the release)

### Tests Fail on Specific Framework

**Problem:** Tests pass on some frameworks but fail on others (e.g., net462).

**Solution:**
1. Check the test logs for framework-specific issues
2. Fix compatibility issues in your code
3. Test locally: `dotnet test --framework net462`
4. Push fix, then re-publish the release (or re-run the workflow from the Actions tab)

### Coverage Below 90% Threshold

**Problem:** Workflow fails at coverage validation step.

**Solution:**
1. Review `CoverageReport/Summary.txt` artifact
2. Add tests for uncovered code paths
3. Ensure tests run on all frameworks
4. Push fix, then re-publish the release (or re-run the workflow from the Actions tab)

### Smoke Test Fails to Install Package

**Problem:** Package packs successfully but fails smoke test installation.

**Solution:**
1. Check package dependencies in `.csproj`
2. Verify framework compatibility in `<TargetFrameworks>`
3. Test locally: `dotnet pack` then try installing in a test project
4. Fix packaging issues and re-publish the release (or re-run the workflow from the Actions tab)

## Production Release Checklist

Before creating a production GitHub Release (e.g., `v1.0.0`):

- [ ] All tests pass on all platforms (pr.yaml workflow)
- [ ] Code coverage meets 90% threshold
- [ ] Security scan shows no critical issues
- [ ] Version numbers updated in `.csproj` files
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated with release notes (if applicable)
- [ ] All PRs merged to `main` branch
- [ ] Local build succeeds: `dotnet build --configuration Release`
- [ ] Local tests pass: `dotnet test --configuration Release`

**Create a production release:**
1. Go to your repository's **Releases** page
2. Click **"Draft a new release"**
3. Choose or create the version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`) targeting `main`
4. Add a title and release notes
5. Click **"Publish release"**

**After workflow completes:**
- [ ] Verify packages appear on NuGet.org
- [ ] Test installing package from NuGet.org in a clean project
- [ ] Announce release (if applicable)
